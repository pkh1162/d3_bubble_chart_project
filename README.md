## react_redux_boilerplate_pkh1162
Simple boilerplate which introduces redux to [facebookincubator/create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). This repo adds a few redux packages to the super
useful create-react-app established by facebookincubator. Included is a simple counter to give you an idea of how redux can be used
with react to create a dynamic web application.

To use this repo, first clone it using:
  - git clone https://github.com/pkh1162/react_redux_boilerplate_pkh1162.git

the install can take a few minutes.
